The repository is dedicated to the clock-in web application developed for Blackhole Creative, using:
* Vue.js
* Node.js
* Express.js

The project was my first full-stack project. The clock-in system includes features like log-in, access control. It also features RWD (responsive web design), enabl swift access via various types of devices seamlessly. The whole project was completed through an autodidact process, all the main componenets in the project were composed by myself alone.
