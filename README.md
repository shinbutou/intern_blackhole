The repository is dedicated to the clock-in web application developed for Blackhole Creative, using:
* Vue.js
* Node.js
* Express.js

The project was my first full-stack project. The clock-in system includes features like log-in, access control. It also features RWD (responsive web design), which enabled easy access via various types of devices seamlessly. The whole project was completed through an autodidact process, all componenets are by myself.
